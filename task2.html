    <p>Christopher Edward Nolan (born 30 July 1970) is a film director, screenwriter and producer of British and American background.</p>
    
    <p> He is one of the highest-grossing directors in history, and among the most successful and acclaimed filmmakers of the 21st century.</p>
    <p>Having made his directorial debut with Following (1998), Nolan gained considerable attention for his second feature, Memento (2000), for which he received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay.

      The acclaim garnered by his independent films gave Nolan the opportunity to make the big-budget thriller Insomnia (2002) and the mystery drama The Prestige (2006).</p>

    
    <p>He found further popular and critical success with The Dark Knight Trilogy (2005â€“2012); Inception (2010), for which he received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Picture and a second Original Screenplay nomination; Interstellar (2014) and Dunkirk (2017).</p>

    <p>His nine films have grossed over US$4.2 billion worldwide and garnered a total of 26 Oscar nominations and seven wins.</p>
    <p>Nolan's films are rooted in philosophical, sociological and ethical concepts, exploring human morality, the construction of time, and the malleable nature of memory and personal identity.</p>
    <p> His body of work is permeated by materialistic perspectives, labyrinthine plots, nonlinear storytelling, practical special effects, and analogous relationships between visual language and narrative elements.
